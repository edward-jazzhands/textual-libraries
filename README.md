# Textual Libraries

[Textual Libraries website](https://edward-jazzhands.github.io/textual-libraries)

This website is dedicated to keeping a centralized list of all the libraries and plugins designed by the Textual community and designed for other Textual creators to use in their own apps.

## Contributing

To make a submission:

1) Fork the repo
2) Make a copy of any post in the _posts folder. Follow the template and substitute in your own information.
3) Place a screenshot of your library in assets/img/posts, and ensure it matches the img option in your post header.
4) Submit a PR with these changes.

I'm hoping that if we all work together, we can make the perfect resource for people looking for third-party libraries, as well as give library creators a fancy venue for showcasing their libraries to other Textual creators.
