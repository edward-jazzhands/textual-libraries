# Textual Libraries

[Textual Libraries website](https://edward-jazzhands.github.io/textual-libraries)

[Transcendent Textual List](https://github.com/Textualize/transcendent-textual)

## This website is set to automatically pull information from the Transcendent List

### Submitting Libraries

The List is essentially the official "awesome" list for Textual. The repo is maintained by the Textualize organization.
But they are very open to submissions.

If you have a new Textual library, submit it to the official Transcendent list. When your submission is accepted, the Textual Libraries website will automatically update and list your Library.

For a cover image, that unfortunately won't appear automatically. But I will get a message telling me about the addition. Usually I'll just copy whatever demo / cover image I can find on your library's page or website. If you have a specific image you'd like me to use, feel free to post an issue on this repo.

### Submiting Articles

Post an issue on this repo linking to your article. Alternatively if you head over to the Textualize Discord, you can post it in the #show-and-tell channel and ping me (@Edward Jazzhands).
